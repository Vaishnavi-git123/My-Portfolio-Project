🗣️ How to Explain in an Interview:

“I built a personal portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to demonstrate my frontend development skills. The site includes sections like About, Projects, and Contact.
 It’s fully responsive and deployed using GitHub Pages. One of the goals was to create a professional-looking, user-friendly space where recruiters or collaborators could easily navigate 
through my work and reach out. I also used version control via Git and regularly updated the content as I completed new projects.”
